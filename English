1-You must have Python installed on your computer. You can install Visual Studio Code optionally.
2-First download "pytube" to your computer using terminal: (C:Users/username>pip install pytube)
3-We write our first line command in a file we open : (from pytube import YouTube)
4-We create the field where we will enter the link so that our machine can find the video: (link = input("Link: "))
5-Since our importing place is Youtube, we specify the type of link: (yt = YouTube(link))
6-We indicate that we want to download in the highest quality: (ys = yt.streams.get_highest_resolution())
7- -Optional- Now we add text so that we can understand that the download has started: (print("Download Started..."))
7-We write our command to start the download: (ys.download())
7- -Optional- To see that the download has finished: (print("Download Complete."))

8-After the writing process is complete, it should look like this:
------------------------------------------------------------
from pytube import YouTube

link = input("Link: ")

yt = YouTube(link)
ys = yt.streams.get_highest_resolution()

print("Download Started...")
ys.download()
print("Download Complete.")
------------------------------------------------------------

9-!There are 0 errors in this code sequence.!

10-To run the machine, we write the name of your file(Video_Downloader) in the terminal (cmd) with the .py extension.
Example: C:Users/username>Video_Downloader.py

Download speed varies according to video length..
